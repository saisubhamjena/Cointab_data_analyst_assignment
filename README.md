# Problem Statement:
X is an e-commerce company that gets a thousand orders via their website on a daily basis, and they have to deliver them as fast as they can.
For delivering the goods ordered by the customers, X has tied up with multiple courier companies in India as delivery partners who charge them some amount per delivery.
As the amount that X has to pay to the courier companies is very high, they want to verify if the charges levied by their Delivery partners per Order are correct.

We were provided with five datasets: Orders, Invoice, Rates, Pincodes and SKU. We need to perform EDA to verift the shipping charges.
